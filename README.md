React Refresher

Things I learnt:
importing custom functions do not need brackets
hooks - normal function used in a component. Name starts with 'use' for a better understanding and clarity
lazy loading - 
    1. use 'lazy' keyword to import that route along with adding it to the 'App' as a path.
    2. wrap your component path in 'suspense' in the 'app' component
    3. add a fallback jsx (or Shimmer ui), so reacts knows what to render when the component is not available
